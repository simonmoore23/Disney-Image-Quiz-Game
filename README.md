#### Description

- Our motivation for this project was to create a website that hosted tech news as well as a way to review and compare SmartPhones.
- We are building this project so the world has a place to go to review and compare new and existing mobile phones.
- This tool will help make the world a better place by giving them all information and an opportunity to review and compare phones before buying them. 
- Whilst working on this project we hope to learn about working as a team on GitHub and creating a product that de-mystifies the SmartPhone market.
