#### Description

- Our motivation for this project was to create a fun game that people can play during their downtime to reminisce about their favourite Disney characters or learn about films they did not know about.
- We are building this project so the world has a place to go to and play a fun game about Disney.
- This tool will help make the world a better place by having a little bit of fun rather than reading about the atrocities on the news.
- Whilst working on this project we hope to learn about working as a team on GitHub and creating a product that is lighthearted and enjoyable.
